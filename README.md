# stockalert


This script sends you alerts when a particular stock price goes below your target level so that you can take a buy call. 
There is a stock.csv file which holds the web-page link to extract the stock price, the threshold value and the stock name. 

The script then sends an emtpy email with the particular stock alert as the subject.
